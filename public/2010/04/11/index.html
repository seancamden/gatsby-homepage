And skills developed designing for print are transferable to Web. But the tools are different, the challenges are different, and so are the possibilities. You won’t have to worry about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">widows and orphans</a> so much. Your <a href="http://www.ampsoft.net/webdesign-l/WindowsMacFonts.html">font choices</a> are a lot fewer. Instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leading">leading</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning">tracking</a> you now have <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_dim_line-height.asp">line-height</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_text_letter-spacing.asp">letter-spacing</a> (kerning isn’t adjustable with CSS). You will have to worry about things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-browser">cross-browser compatibility</a>, not to mention <a href="http://forabeautifulweb.com/classes/on/accessibility">accessibility</a>, and <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">standards</a>. But you’ll also have a much shorter wait to see your work published, and can interact with your users in ways that were simply impossible with print.</p>
<p>The Web is an exciting place. Technologies come and go quickly and it can be difficult to keep up, but it can be fun, too. Here is a list that is totally not exhaustive but, I think, covers some very important steps towards becoming comfortable with designing for the Web, particularly for someone already experienced at designing for print.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">Learn HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">learn CSS</a>, too. HTML defines the nuts and bolts of everything on the Web. CSS is what you use to make it look nice. <a href="http://www.cssbeauty.com/gallery/">CSS is pretty cool</a> and provides a <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">wide range of design options</a> and <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/are-you-making-these-10-css-mistakes/">limitations</a> that, unless you understand the working parameters, are not going to be intuitive to someone coming from a print background. The w3schools.com lessons are great, but to dive deeper without breaking the bank, classes at the <a href="http://www.oreillyschool.com/courses/htmlcss/">O’Reilly School of Technology</a> are a sensible option.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Since you&#x26;#8217;re already familiar with Adobe products, and might even have a copy of Dreamweaver since it comes with several suites, you may be tempted to skip learning HTML and CSS. **Don&#x26;#8217;t.** Imagine being hired as a chef but not knowing how to cook. The quality of the device that promises to do the cooking for you is irrelevant. If your intention is to be a skilled practitioner, you will have to learn the trade. And you&#x26;#8217;ll need a [text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors) (not to be confused with a word processor). [NoteTab](http://www.notetab.com/) is a good one for Windows, or [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/TextWrangler/) for Mac.

Also, be concerned about good [UI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface). In the same way that someone might expect a book to have its TOC come before its content, a web site and its navigation must be intuitive in order to be useful. [Steve Krug](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Common-Sense-Approach-Usability/dp/0789723107) and [Jakob Nielsen](http://www.useit.com/) are two authors/researchers who have explored this field, and you might find their work helpful. If you&#x26;#8217;ve ever cursed a new ATM or debit machine because the OK button wasn&#x26;#8217;t where you expected it to be, you already know the importance of good UI. Learning more will not only make your clients happy, it will make the Web a better place, too. At any rate, be careful not to reinvent things if you don&#x26;#8217;t have to.

<ol start="2">
<li>Do some blogging. Get a free blog from <a href="http://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a> or <a href="https://www.blogger.com/start">Blogger.com</a> and post a few things. Post about the weather, post about the books you read. The subject matter is not important. To start, this is just a way to get the feel of how things work on the Web, what it’s like to be a Web author. Ultimately, your blog will be your first line of communication online, so don’t post anything too crazy.</li>
<li>Buy a domain. Buy a few domains; they’re cheap. Your domain is, sort of, the online equivalent to a storefront, and they can be fun, too. <a href="http://instantdomainsearch.com/">Think up a cool name that no one else has thought</a> of and buy it at any of the online registrars like directnic or godaddy.</li>
<li>Get a site hosted. You’ll need to pay a web host (but not very much) and then follow some instructions to upload your site to the host servers. This site is currently hosted at <a href="http://laughingsquid.us/">Laughing Squid</a>, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=web+hosting&#x26;ie=utf-8&#x26;oe=utf-8&#x26;aq=t&#x26;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#x26;client=firefox-a">many, many others</a> can easily be found. You’ll also need an FTP program of some sort. <a href="http://fileZilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a> is a fine choice (and free), but many other <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ftp+software&#x26;ie=utf-8&#x26;oe=utf-8&#x26;aq=t&#x26;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#x26;client=firefox-a">FTP programs</a> are available.</li>
<li>Learn about <a href="http://www.getclicky.com/">web analytics</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization">SEO</a>, and <a href="http://www.Google.com/AdWords">online advertising</a>. Your clients will need this stuff because, unlike a brick and mortar storefront, a “location, location, location” on the Web has to be generated, generated, generated.</li>
