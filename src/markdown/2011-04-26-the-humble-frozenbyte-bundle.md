[The Humble Bundle returns](http://www.humblebundle.com/) with games from [Frozenbyte, an independent game development company](http://frozenbyte.com/).

I don&#8217;t actually have time to play games much these days, but I love supporting [DRM](http://www.defectivebydesign.org/what_is_drm)-free software. For my $50 (I picked the amount!) I got not only the games themselves, which I can download from their servers as many times as I need for whichever of three operating systems I need, but also the games&#8217; soundtracks are included as folders of MP3s. And the tracks, all written by [Ari Pulkkinen](http://www.aripulkkinen.com/), are quite good.
