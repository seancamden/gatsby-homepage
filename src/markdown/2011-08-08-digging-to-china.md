China is the place I always imagined I would end up if I simply started digging straight down and didn&#8217;t stop. I developed this conviction with the help of those stalwart researchers at Looney Tunes University (I seem to recall professors Fudd and Bunny demonstrating quite clearly how this was the case). But it turns out the actual spot is at the bottom of the Indian Ocean about a thousand miles south east of Madagascar.
