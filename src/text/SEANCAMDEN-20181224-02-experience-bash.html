<h2>Education   </h2>
<p>Mostly I've taught myself how to do this stuff. I'm easily fascinated  (distracted) and this has lead to a repertoire that is broader than it is  deep. But I'm pretty good at a few things, too.  </p>
  
<p>I'm also pretty cheap. So, while my friends were building expensive gaming rigs, I was turning old, hand-me-down computers (a buddy once mailed me his old motherboard from Hong Kong) into Web servers and file servers and experimenting with different flavors of Linux and Web technologies. I'm very happy to be running my current (local) servers on computers about the size of a deck of playing cards (I heart Raspberry Pi).</p>
