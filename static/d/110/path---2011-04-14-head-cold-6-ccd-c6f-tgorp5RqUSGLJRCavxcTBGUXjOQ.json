I want the interface to work. If the doctor is in, it should not say that he is out. And in the event that it reports things incorrectly, I would like the doctors to accept responsibility for their organization’s system and apologize for my inconvenience. And if I can’t expect what in my opinion is a modicum of service, then why am I paying so dearly for it? Shouldn’t this level of sloppy service be easily achieved by some socialist healthcare system?</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 14, 2011","path":"/2011/04/14/head-cold-6","title":"Head Cold 6"}}},"pageContext":{}}
