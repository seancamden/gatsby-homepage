I’ve been on Nyquil for the last four nights and so have been sleeping well. But I’ve also been working 12+ hour days for the last two or three weeks. Any advice? (Tomorrow is my last day on my current gig.) Thanks!</p>\n<p>Just in case you don’t remember me: I’m Doctor #1’s patient who had pneumonia a few months ago.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 07, 2011","path":"/2011/04/07","title":"Cold leading to ear ache"}}},"pageContext":{}}
